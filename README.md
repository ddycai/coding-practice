Coding Interview
================

A collection of code I've written for coding interview practice.
The questions are from Cracking the Coding Interview, 5th ed and are organized by chapter.
Each file begins with the question it is for followed by (in most cases) an
explanation of the solution. I did refer to the answers for some solutions so
they will be similar. Hopefully my explanations will offer a bit more
insight.

* ch03 - linear data structures: stacks, queues
* ch04 - more data structures: trees, graphs
* ch05 - bit manipulation
* ch07 - mathematics and probability
* ch09 - recursion and dynamic programming
* ch11 - sorting and searching
* ch17 - moderate review problems
