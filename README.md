Coding Interview
================

A collection of code I've written for coding interview practice.
The questions are from Cracking the Coding Interview, 5th ed and are organized by chapter.
Each question begins with the question it is for.

ch03 - linear data structures: stacks, queues
ch04 - more data structures: trees, graphs
ch05 - bit manipulation
ch07 - mathematics and probability
ch09 - recursion and dynamic programming
ch11 - sorting and searching
