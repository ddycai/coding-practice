/*
 * A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight
 * consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w
 * is divisible by 8. The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from
 * the length of the array and the width. Implement a function
 * drawHorizontalLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y) which
 * draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).
 *
 * Solution: I have not done this question yet.
